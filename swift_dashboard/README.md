## 5. Start Services

### Start OpenSearch

```bash
./bin/opensearch.bat
```

### Start OpenSearch Dashboards

```bash
./bin/opensearch-dashboards.bat
```

Access Dashboards at [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601)

---

## 6. Verify Setup

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5601`
2. You should see the OpenSearch Dashboards UI
3. Create indices, build visualizations, or explore logs

---

## 7. Add a Custom Plugin to OpenSearch Dashboards

### Step 1: Clone the OpenSearch Dashboards Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards.git
cd OpenSearch-Dashboards
```

### Step 2: Bootstrap the OpenSearch Dashboards Development Environment

```bash
yarn osd bootstrap
```

> Use **Node.js v18** for optimal compatibility.

### Step 3: Add Your React Project

Place your plugin (React project) inside the `plugins` directory of OpenSearch Dashboards.

* Frontend UI components should go inside the `public` folder.
* Backend/server logic should go inside the `server` folder.

Ensure you use `App.tsx`, `index.ts`, and `plugin.ts` that follow the plugin structure and component usage patterns defined in the OpenSearch Dashboards project.

Your `package.json` should contain a build script like:

```json
"build": "yarn node ../../scripts/plugin_helpers build"
```

> Follow the existing plugin structure carefully for consistency and component usage patterns.

### Step 4: Build the Plugin

Before building, install dependencies:

```bash
cd plugins/your-plugin-name
yarn install
```

Then build your plugin:

```bash
yarn build
```

### Step 5: Install the Built Plugin into a Packaged Dashboard

Use the `opensearch-dashboards-plugin` utility inside the downloaded OpenSearch Dashboards package to install the plugin zip:

```bash
opensearch-dashboards-plugin.bat install file:///C:/Users/Ajai/Desktop/OpenSearch_Dashboards/OpenSearch-Dashboards/plugins/swift-dashboard-backend/build/swiftDashboard-2.19.0.zip
```

> Replace the path with the actual location of your built plugin zip.

Once installed, launch OpenSearch Dashboards. Your plugin should appear on the left-hand panel.

**Note:** Each time you make changes to your plugin:

* Rebuild the plugin (`yarn build`)
* Remove the previous version from the plugin directory before reinstalling
